Idea
-----

Stamprr was created to help analysts study performance of tagged content for
brands managed at VaynerMedia.

Process
-------

Stamprr pulls post level data from [Grout](https://github.com/martinez-angel/grout) daily.
It allows Community Managers on respective brands to tag each piece of content
they post. This allows analysts to go in and compare the performance of
different pieces of content to each other.

Rookie Mistakes
---------------

I know it's not perfect, but it solved a real business need and saved a buttload of time for the
team.
